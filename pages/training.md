# **Training**

Alignment is an important key to success when undertaking any large effort. Training helps build this alignment and can provide a great kickstart to teams and organizations new to agile concepts or provide the boast needed to get your efforts back on track.

To aid with this alignment, most of the courses offered are aligned with Scrum.org to ensure consistent, high value training. Customized courses and workshops are available upon request.
